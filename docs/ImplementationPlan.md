# Implementation Plan

## Planning Constraints
- Additive implementation only; keep repository buildable at each phase.
- Never rename modules once introduced.
- Deterministic sim/replay/hash verification precede advanced features.
- This phase remains documentation-only.



## Program Milestones (Cross-Phase Gates)
- **M0 Architecture Lock**: determinism plan, bullet/collision architecture, Pattern Graph/IR specs approved.
- **M1 First Playable Simulation**: fixed-step loop + sandbox rendering + input movement.
- **M2 1,000 Bullet Stress**: no-allocation bullet runtime baseline.
- **M3 Collision + Graze Prototype**: deterministic overlap + graze events working.
- **M4 10,000 Bullet Stress**: sustained deterministic stress and hash stability.
- **M5 Pattern VM v1**: authored patterns compile and execute deterministically.
- **M6 Pattern Editor Prototype**: graph/timeline pattern authoring with live preview.
- **M7 Replay v1**: input/seed/content-hash replay with divergence diagnostics.
- **M8 Boss Vertical Slice**: full boss encounter authored via tools.
- **M9 Full Demo Loop**: stage map, encounters, rewards, boss, progression.
- **M10 1.0 RC**: docs/templates/plugin+mod baseline and release-readiness checks passed.

## Phase Framework Alignment
This plan uses additive buildable phases that map to the product program sequence:
- Foundations/pre-production intent is represented by Phase 1 documentation lock and milestone M0.
- Runtime, bullet, collision, pattern, tools, gameplay, pipeline, optimization, and polish intent are distributed across Phases 2–10 with explicit Windows validation commands.

## Execution Status Update (Phase 3)
- **Completed implementation in repository**:
  - Engine skeleton build graph with SDL2, Dear ImGui, stb_image, stb_truetype, nlohmann_json.
  - Fixed-step core runtime loop with render separation and headless mode.
  - Runtime services: logging, config, deterministic RNG streams, job system, frame allocator/object pool helpers.
  - Unit tests: timing and configuration (`ctest`).

## 2026-03-07 — GameplaySession architecture refactor (runtime boundaries)

### Scope implemented
- Split `GameplaySession` runtime ownership into six state partitions:
  - `SessionSimulationState` (tick/clock/frame allocator/rng streams)
  - `PlayerCombatState` (player transform/aim/health/radius)
  - `ProgressionState` (upgrade screen + focus + progression memo indices)
  - `PresentationState` (camera shake queue, particle FX, danger-field runtime)
  - `DebugToolState` (tool suite, debug/perf flags, profiling labels)
  - `EncounterRuntimeState` (collision target/event buffers and rolling collision counters)
- Updated runtime integration (`Runtime`) to consume tool state and tick state through the new boundaries.
- Added `gameplay_session_state_tests` to validate that getter APIs and partitioned ownership remain aligned.

### Migration / integration notes
- Existing call-sites continue to use stable `GameplaySession` methods (`playerPos()`, `dangerFieldEnabled()`, `consumeCameraShakeEvents()`, etc.).
- Internal members formerly accessed as top-level `GameplaySession` fields now route through partition roots (e.g., `simulation_`, `playerState_`, `presentation_`, `debugTools_`, `encounter_`, `progression_`).
- Replay and deterministic systems were kept in place; tick/replay logic now reads tick from `simulation_.tickIndex`.


## Editor Tools Decomposition — Delivered
- [x] Broke the monolithic `drawControlCenter` flow into modular panel methods aligned with tool domains.
- [x] Added explicit shared editor service methods for encounter asset build and panel state seeding.
- [x] Kept existing panel behavior and menu toggles intact (content browser, graph editor, encounter editor, palette/FX, validator, profiler, debug).
- [x] Preserved runtime/editor contract through `ToolRuntimeSnapshot` read-only consumption in panel methods.

### Migration notes
- Existing external API remained stable (`ControlCenterToolSuite` public methods unchanged).
- Internal contributors should add new tools as dedicated panel methods and avoid adding large inline UI blocks to `drawControlCenter`.

### Future extension points
- Introduce a lightweight panel registry that maps menu toggles to panel method delegates.
- Move shared panel state structs into dedicated editor service files once additional tooling lands.

## 2026-03-07 — Asset Pipeline: Sprite/Texture Import (Completed)

Completed items:

- Added source asset import registry model (`SourceArtAssetRecord`, `ImportedArtAssetRecord`) in `content_pipeline`.
- Implemented manifest parsing + validation for sprite/texture source assets and import settings.
- Added import fingerprinting, previous-pack reimport comparison, and dependency invalidation output.
- Added atlas build planning output grouped by atlas group and color workflow.
- Integrated import metadata into generated runtime packs (`sourceAssetRegistry`, `importRegistry`, `importInvalidations`, `atlasBuild`).
- Added automated coverage:
  - `content_import_pipeline_tests` for parse/import/atlas/fingerprint behavior.
  - updated `content_packer_tests` to assert new import metadata fields in produced packs.
- Added authored sample manifest and source art examples under `data/`.
